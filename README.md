# LTCC Advanced Computational Methods in Statistics
This course will provide an overview of Monte Carlo methods when used for problems in Statistics. After an introduction to simulation, its purpose and challenges, we will cover in more detail Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo. Whilst the main focus will be on the methodology and its relevance to applications, we will often mention relevant theoretical results and their importance for problems in practice. 

Keywords: Simulation, Variance reduction, Monte Carlo methods, Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo

This course is under construction and is meant to be delivered in Oct 2020 for [LTCC](http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/). Here is the official link of the course: http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/courses/advanced-computational-methods-in-statistics/

 
Immediately below you can find the course outline together the with links to slides and video-lectures. I will try to list all the video lectures in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnLW5bw8rfk3Tt4K8YrH7tPyLH9XKzGo2). At the bottom of this page you can find more details on assessment, reading list, prerequisites, format etc.

# Introduction

We will split the introduction into two parts:

- Introduction to Monte Carlo  [slides](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/intro_mc.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqDItPClDiM)

- Basic Indirect Sampling methods (Rejection Sampling and Importance Sampling)  [slides](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/intro_mc2.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Nt3GQFj3Y)

<!---## Older lecture slides

For you convenience i am listing the slides used in previous years. You might notice this year's course has been broken down and changed a bit.

 - [Slides 1](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides1.pdf)
 - [Slides 2](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides2.pdf)
 - [Slides 3](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides3.pdf)
 - [Slides 4](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides4.pdf)-->

## Prerequisites: 

 - Basic knowledge of Statistics and Probability. 
  
 - Basic knowledge of programming in any language appropriate for scientific computing.
  
 - Familiarity and exposure to Markov Chains or stochastic processes will be useful.

## Format:

- There will be optional exercises or small courseworks posed as quizes or homeworks. There will be no separate problem sheets. Some problems will require the use of some programming.

- Lecture/computer session/tutorial/discussion hours split: 10/0 /0 /0 /0
