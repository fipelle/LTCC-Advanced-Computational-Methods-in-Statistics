# LTCC-Advanced-Computational-Methods-in-Statistics
This course will provide an overview of Monte Carlo methods when used for problems in Statistics. After an introduction to simulation, its purpose and challenges, we will cover in more detail Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo. Whilst the main focus will be on the methodology and its relevance to applications, we will often mention relevant theoretical results and their importance for problems in practice. 

Keywords: Simulation, Variance reduction, Monte Carlo methods, Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo

This course is under construction to be delivering in Oct 2020 for [LTCC](http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/). Here is the official link of the course: http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/courses/advanced-computational-methods-in-statistics/

Prerequisites: 

  ∗ Basic knowledge of Statistics and Probability. 
  
  ∗ Basic knowledge of programming in any language appropriate for scientific computing.
  
  ∗ Familiarity and exposure to Markov Chains or stochastic processes will be useful.

Format:

  * There will be optional exersizes or small courseworks posed as homeworks. There will be no separate problem sheets. The problems will require the use of some programming.
