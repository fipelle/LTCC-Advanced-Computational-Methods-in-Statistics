# LTCC Advanced Computational Methods in Statistics
This course will provide an overview of Monte Carlo methods when used for problems in Statistics. After an introduction to simulation, its purpose and challenges, we will cover in more detail Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo. Whilst the main focus will be on the methodology and its relevance to applications, we will often mention relevant theoretical results and their importance for problems in practice. 

Keywords: Simulation, Variance reduction, Monte Carlo methods, Importance Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo

This course is under construction to be delivering in Oct 2020 for [LTCC](http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/). Here is the official link of the course: http://www.ltcc.ac.uk/courses/advanced-computational-methods-in-statistics/

At the bottom of this page you can find more details on assessment, prerequisites, format etc.

# Introduction

We will split the introduction into two parts:

- Introduction to Monte Carlo  [slides](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides1.pdf) and video (link TBA soon)

- Basic Monte Carlo methods (Rejection Sampling and Importance Sampling)

- Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo [slides](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/slides2.pdf)


# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

We will mainly discuss various topics and provide some some basics on theory and practice.

- Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling 
  
- Markov Chain Theory related to MCMC


# Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
  
  - particle filtering for state space models
  
  - sampling for fixed dimensional state spaces
  
  - particle MCMC
